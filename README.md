Hi, I'm Parivallal J 👋

Frontend Developer — React.js | Redux | TypeScript | JavaScript (ES6+)

I build dynamic, scalable, and responsive web applications with a strong focus on component-driven architecture, performance, and clean DX. 2+ years of production experience shipping features in React, state management with Redux/Zustand, and modern tooling (Webpack, Babel). I love crafting accessible UIs with Tailwind CSS and Ant Design, and integrating APIs (REST & GraphQL) to bring products to life.
